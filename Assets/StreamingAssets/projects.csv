This pollution database (PDB) keeps track of those organizations polluting, how much pollution they are releasing and their cleanup efforts.  Ryan Bailey specifically worked on the back end of the database by creating the database schema as well as multiple queries.  Using PHP, he stripped down five excel spreadsheets of pollution data into queries to fill the database.

"0029","amg_powerwall","Live","Work","AMG Powerwall","The AMG Powerwall experience is a two screen vehicle configurator installed in Mercedes-Benz AMG dealerships across the US.  In the dealership, a wireless touch screen can be used to select a vehicle which can then be explored in depth on a massive multi-screen display.  That 3D rendered vehicle can then be exploded and its individual components can be explored one by one.  Each vehicle has at least five components which in turn separate and perform unique, informative animation sequences.  The interior of the vehicle can also be explored and customized using streamed 360 images from a Mercedes-Benz media server configurator.  This project was nominated for ‚ÄòBest VizSim Project‚Äô at the 2016 Unite awards.","Following the creation of a single vehicle prototype by All Things Media‚Äôs prototype lead, Ryan Bailey architected multiple frameworks for integrating the full Mercedes-Benz AMG product line of vehicles and components into a complicated two screen experience.  He then led a team of developers in implementing the architecture into multiple complex frameworks for configuration, networking, and 3D asset editor setup that would eventually be used for other projects moving forward.  All Things Media‚Äôs 3D team used multiple 3ds max and unity scripts created by Ryan and his development team to get the supplied vehicle and component CAD files into the Unity application with minimal effort.","Summer 2016","All Things Media, LLC.","Lead Programmer","C#,Unity3d","PC"
"0030","cadillac_vr","Live","Work","Cadillac Virtual Showroom","Cadillac Virtual Showroom is a vehicle configurator created for HTC Vive headsets that is currently used in multiple Cadillac showrooms.  Cadillac showrooms tend to have a very small stock of vehicles on site.  Cadillac Virtual Showroom opens up customers to fully configuring their vehicle down to the trim and upholstery with photo real accuracy.  Within the first month of use in a Cadillac showroom, dealers were reporting a significant increase in sales especially for vehicles not on site that were configured in virtual reality.  Cadillac Virtual Showroom was nominated for ‚ÄòBest VizSim Project‚Äô at the 2017 Unite Awards.  The application was also shown in the ‚ÄòMade with Unity Showcase‚Äô at Unite Austin 2017.","Ryan Bailey architected and led the development of the Cadillac Virtual Showroom programming team.  Ryan created a comprehensive pipeline for integrating vehicles with full configuration into the platform, eventually incorporating the entire Cadillac vehicle line.
